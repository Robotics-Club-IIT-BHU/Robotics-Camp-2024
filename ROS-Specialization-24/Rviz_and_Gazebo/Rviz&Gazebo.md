<h2 align="center">RViz</h2>


**Visualisation** is the key which make robotics fun, Generally we want to see what the robot is seeing, how its joints, links are behaving while interacting with environment etc.... so for these purposes ROS has a package RViz(known as ROS Visualiser) to allow us to see and visualise all these things.

**Key features of RViz:**

* **Variety of display types:** Supports various visualizations like point clouds, images, robot models, and robot paths.
* **Interactive:** Allows you to zoom, pan, and rotate the view for better inspection of the simulation environment.
* **Customization:** You can configure the appearance and behavior of each display type for a tailored experience.

**Using RViz with Gazebo:**

RViz excels at visualizing data generated by robot simulation tools like Gazebo. It works seamlessly with Gazebo, RViz can display your robot's movement, sensor readings, and the surrounding environment in real-time.

<h2 align="center">Gazebo</h2>

Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. While similar to game engines, Gazebo offers physics simulation at a much higher degree of fidelity, a suite of sensors, and interfaces for both users and programs.

***Typical uses of Gazebo include:***

- testing robotics algorithms,
- designing robots,
- performing regression testing with realistic scenarios

***A few key features of Gazebo include:***

- multiple physics engines,
- a rich library of robot models and environments,
- a wide variety of sensors,
- convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces

**Benefits of using Gazebo:**

* **Safe testing:** Experiment with robot behavior without risking damage to physical hardware.
* **Repeatable tests:** Conduct controlled experiments with consistent environmental conditions.
* **Development environment:** Test and refine robot algorithms before deployment on real robots.

### Gazebo Plugins

Gazebo plugins are software modules that extend the functionalities of Gazebo. They allow you to:

* **Simulate custom sensors:** Implement models for sensors not natively supported by Gazebo, like custom cameras or LiDAR configurations.
* **Model complex actuators:** Simulate the behavior of specific actuators used in your robot that might not be included in the standard library.
* **Introduce custom behaviors:** Create plugins to define specific environmental effects or robot functionalities not readily available in Gazebo.

Enough definitions and learning we will simulate a robot and move it gazebo. Excited? See Task 3

#### Remember these are tools and it will take time to master these, my suggestion is to just read this, watch some youtube vids. Proceed to the next section and slowly you will get a grip of these.
