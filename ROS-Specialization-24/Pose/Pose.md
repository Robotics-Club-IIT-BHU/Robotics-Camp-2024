# Understanding Pose in ROS

## What is [Pose](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Pose.html)?

In the context of ROS (Robot Operating System) and robotics in general, a **pose** represents the position and orientation of a robot or an object in space. It is typically described using a combination of position coordinates (x, y, z) and orientation (represented as a quaternion or Euler angles).

## How Pose is Represented

In ROS, pose is commonly represented using the `geometry_msgs/Pose` message, which includes:
- `geometry_msgs/Point` for position (x, y, z)
- `geometry_msgs/Quaternion` for orientation (x, y, z, w)

### Example of Pose Message
```yaml
geometry_msgs/Pose:
  position:
    x: 1.0
    y: 2.0
    z: 0.0
  orientation:
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0
    w: 1.0
```

>    What do position and orientation variables refer to in this context? Position and orientation of what relative to what? What does the origin refer to, where is it specified and how is it retrieved?

geometry_msgs/Pose is a 6D Cartesian pose, relative to 'nothing' - or whatever the sender and receiver agree upon out of band.

>    A representation of pose in free space, composed of position and orientation.

geometry_msgs/PoseStamped is also a 6D Cartesian pose, but the message includes a header, which include a frame_id field which allows the sender to specify to what the pose is relative. Yes to get poses in different frames we use TFs and all of this is generally managed by [robot state publisher](http://wiki.ros.org/robot_state_publisher) and [joint state publisher](http://wiki.ros.org/joint_state_publisher).

>    A Pose with reference coordinate frame and timestamp

Note that this header also includes a stamp field, so not only is a PoseStamped explicit wrt its space dimension, but also the time dimension.


>    I don't understand the 4d orientation vector for example. I guess this is a [quaternion](http://docs.ros.org/en/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Quaternion.html)?

So, yes. orientation is of type [Quaternion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMuIxRvygQ). You can always check youtube to know more about anything that you didn't get.
