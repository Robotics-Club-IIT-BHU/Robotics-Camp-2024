# Pytorch
  
  We first taught you how to code in tensorflow but most of the industries uses pytorch and tensorflow is rarely used in real life examples.

  So let's Learn Pytorch
  
  ## Introduction 
  
  - Itâ€™s a Python based scientific computing package targeted at two sets of audiences:
      - A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs
      - Deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed
  - pros:
      - Interactively debugging PyTorch. Many users who have used both frameworks would argue that makes pytorch significantly easier to debug and visualize.
      - Clean support for dynamic graphs
      - Organizational backing from Facebook
      - Blend of high level and low level APIs
  - cons:
    - Much less mature than alternatives
    - Limited references / resources outside of the official documentation
  
  See the three jupyter notebooks on Pytorch Tutorials
  
  Also we really have many good playlist on YouTube on PyTorch
  
  [Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4) Only till 13th tutorial
  
  [Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_lsbAsL_o2CTlGHgMxNrKhzP97BaG9ZN) Only till 6th tutorial
