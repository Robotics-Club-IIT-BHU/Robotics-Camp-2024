# Welcome to the world of neural networks

Have you ever wondered how your smartphone recognizes your face to unlock itself, or how Google assistant and ChatGPT can answer anything you want to ask? These everyday marvels are powered by a technology called neural networks, which are at the heart of many of today's most advanced artificial intelligence systems.

The beauty of neural networks lies in their ability to learn from examples. Through a process called training, neural networks analyze vast amounts of data to refine their internal parameters, adjusting their responses to improve accuracy over time. This capability makes them incredibly versatile across a wide range of applications.
