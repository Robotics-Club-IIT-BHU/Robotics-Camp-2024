## Build a Simple 2R Robotic Arm (URDF)

This task introduces you to building a basic robotic arm using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF). The robot you'll create, called a "2R Planar Robot Arm," features two revolute joints that connect a base to two links.

What You'll Do:

* Understand the Design: A resource link (or image) will show the robot's structure. Look for two circles representing the revolute joints and links with lengths l1 and l2.

* Build with Simple Shapes:  Don't worry about complex 3D models!  Instead, use a text editor to build the robot's URDF description by visualizing it as a combination of simple shapes like boxes and cylinders.

* Leverage Starter Code: A sample starter code for the URDF file is already available in the designated folder. This code provides a basic structure to build upon.

* Focus on Visual Appearance: While URDF can define various robot properties, for now, you'll focus on how it looks.  Add tags like <visual> and <geometry> to define the robot's visual appearance using simple shapes. Don't worry about properties like mass, collision, and inertia yet – these will be covered later.

Deliverable:

A completed URDF file within the designated folder, defining the robot's visual appearance using simple shapes and relevant tags.

**Use the URDF Visualiser to check your progess**

Let's build your first robotic arm! This task lays the foundation for further exploration of robot simulation and functionality.
