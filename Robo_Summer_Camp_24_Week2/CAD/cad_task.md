# TASK 1: Design a 3D Pulley Support System 

Follow the provided schematic to create a 3D model of a pulley support system in your preferred CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360).

* Analyze the schematic: identify components (base, bracket, etc.) and dimensions.
* Model each component accurately based on the schematic specifications.
* Consider creating a sub-assembly for the complete system (optional).
* Save your model in a compatible format (e.g., .STL, .F3D, .STEP).
Deliverable: A 3D model of the pulley support system in your chosen CAD software format.

# TASK 2: Design a 3D F450 Drone Chassis

Put your CAD skills to the test! Design a 3D model of an F450 drone chassis using the provided schematics (dimensions) in your preferred CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360).

* Analyze schematics for chassis dimensions (width, height, motor mount locations).
* Model the chassis accurately based on specifications (consider hollow arms for realism).
* Create a sub-assembly for the complete chassis with additional components (optional).
* Save your model in a compatible format (e.g., .STL, .F3D, .STEP).
Deliverable: A 3D model of the F450 drone chassis in your chosen CAD software format.
